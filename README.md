# Sprint8Project
In this project we will analyze a database composed of 10,000 Beta Bank customers, with the purpose of training different Machine Learning models that can predict the permanence of customers in the bank. We will train three  algorithms (***Decision Tree***, ***Random Forest*** and ***Logistic Regression***) with a series of features that reflect the financial status and saving habits of customers, in order to have a variety of models able to predict the target variable ('Exited') with a reasonable degree of confidence.<br>
The first step will be to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on separating the ***'features'*** and ***'target'*** variables, defining the relevant features for the model, and preparing the data for machine learning using the techniques of ***One Hot Encoding (OHE)***, ***Label Encoding*** and ***Scalar Standardization***. We will then train three algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) and note their initial performance, in a ***Class Imbalance*** state. In order to improve the performance of the models, we will use different techniques to mitigate class imbalance, such as the parameter ***class_weight='balanced'*** and ***upsampling/downsampling*** the training sets. After trying different combinations, we will select the optimal configuration for each algorithm and analyze the improvement in each model. Finally, we will measure the improvement in ***F1 scores*** for each model, test their reliability under different probability thresholds, and plot graphs of ***Recall-Precision curves*** and ***ROC curves with AUC-ROC*** scores to decide which model has the best performance.<br>
